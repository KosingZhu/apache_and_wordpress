# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#
# www.localtest.com HTTPS虚拟主机
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localtest.com
    DocumentRoot "${SRVROOT}/htdocs"
    ServerName www.localtest.com
    ServerAlias localhost
    ErrorLog "logs/localtest.com-ssl-error.log"
    TransferLog "logs/localtest.com-ssl-access.log"
    
    # SSL配置
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile "${SRVROOT}/conf/ssl/server.crt"
    SSLCertificateKeyFile "${SRVROOT}/conf/ssl/server.key"
    
    # SSL协议和加密套件设置
    SSLProtocol all -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1
    SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!3DES
    SSLHonorCipherOrder on
